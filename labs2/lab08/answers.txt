Exercise 1:

Address Reference String: 84, C9, 14, 74, E8, 09, 19, D1, 5C, DE

Cycle 1
- Translate 84 to binary: 1000 0100
- Virtual Address: Page = 100, Offset = 00100
- Look for virtual page = 100 = 4 in TLB
	- Not there --> TLB miss. Valid bit = 0 --> Page fault
	- Need to bring page from hard disk to physical memory
- Memory has room --> Fill frame0 with this page
- Page is Page 4 in VM (brought in from disk to memorry into frame0)
	- Word obtained has an offset of 4
- Physical address also obtained: Physical page frame num = 0 --> page bits in addr = 00 --> Word bits identical to VA (00100)
	- Therefore, physical address = 00 00100 --> 4
- In page table, 4 corresponds to frame num = 0, valid bit = 1

Cycle 2
- Translate C9 to binary: 1100 1001
- Virtual Address: Page = 110, Offset = 01001
- Look for virtual page = 110 = 6 in TLB
	- Not there --> TLB miss. Valid bit = 0 --> Page fault
	- Need to bring page from hard disk to physical memory
- Memory has room --> Fill frame1 with this page
- Page is Page 4 in VM (brought in from disk to memorry into frame0)
	- Word obtained has an offset of 9, as specified by VA
- Physical address also obtained: Physical page frame num = 1 --> page bits in addr = 01 --> Word bits identical to VA (01001)
	- Therefore, physical address = 01 01001 --> 41
- Page table: 4 now corresponds to frame1, valid bit = 1

Cycle 3
- Translate 14 to binary: 0001 0100
- Virtual Address: Page = 000, Offset = 10100
- Look for virtual page = 000 in TLB
	- Not there --> TLB miss. Valid bit = 0 --> Page fault
	- Need to bring page from hard disk to physical memory
- Memory has room --> Fill frame2 with this page
- Page is Page 0 in VM (brought in from disk to memorry into frame0)
	- Word obtained has an offset of 10100, as specified by VA
- Physical address also obtained: Physical page frame num = 2 --> page bits in addr = 10 --> Word bits identical to VA (10100)
	- Therefore, physical address = 10 10100 --> 84

Cycle 4
- Translate E8 to binary: 1110 1000
- Virtual Address: Page = 111, Offset = 01000
- Look for virtual page = 111 in TLB
	- Not there --> TLB miss. Valid bit = 0 --> Page fault
	- Need to bring page from hard disk to physical memory
- Memory does NOT room --> Need to kick out least recently used frame = frame0
	- Also need to replace corresponding entry in TLB: VPN = 4, PPN = 0 replaced w/ VPN = 7, PPN = 0
- Page is Page 7 in VM (brought in from disk to memory into frame0)
	- Word obtained has an offset of 01000, as specified by VA
- Physical address also obtained: Physical page frame num = 0 --> page bits in addr = 0 --> Word bits identical to VA (01000)
	- Therefore, physical address = 00 01000 --> 9
- Page table: now contains for row7: frame number = 0, valid bit = 1

Cycle 5
- Translate 09 into binary: 000 01001
- Virtual Address: Page = 000, Offset = 01001
- Look for virtual page = 000 in TLB
	- Present --> TLB Hit! PPN = 2
- Physical address also obtained: Physical page frame num = 2 --> page bits in addr = 10 --> Word bits identical to VA (01001)
	- Therefore, physical address = 10 01001 = 73

...

    1. 5 offset bits --> 32 Bytes
    2. TLB Hits/Misses: 4, 6; Page Hits/Faults: 6, 0
    3. There were no pagehits.
    - Key question: how could there be a page hit?
    	- Would it require the same frame number in the page table... ??


Exercise 2:

000 00000 = 00
001 00000 = 20
010 00000 = 40
011 00000 = 60
100 00000 = 80

000 00000 = 00
001 00000 = 20
010 00000 = 40
011 00000 = 60
100 00000 = 80

Rationale: Keeping the VPN different forces replacement in TLB (can't rehash results)


    1. 00, 20, 40, 60, 80, 00, 20, 40, 60, 80

Exercise 3:

- Task: how to maintain 10 TLB misses while having < 10 page faults?
	- Larger physical memory --> More page frames can be accommodated
	- More page frames in memory (5+ frames) --> page hits could occur alongside TLB misses

Exercise 1 Checkoff Questions:
    1. See Above
    2. PA has 2 bits to reference the 4 frames. VA has 3 bits b/c there are 7 entries in page table

Exercise 4 Checkoff Question:
    1. I am confused...
