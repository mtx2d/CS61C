1. Four floating point division in single precision:
Ans:  __m128 _mm_div_ps (__m128 a, __m128 b)
- Divide packed single precision (32 bit) floating point elements in a by packed elements in b, storing results in dst
2. Sixteen max operations over signed 8 bit integers (char)
Ans: __m128i _mm_max_epi8(__m128i a, __m128i b)
- What does m128i vs m128 mean?
3. Arithmetic shift right of eight signed 16 bit integers (short)
Ans: __mm_sra_epi16 (__m128i a, __m128i count)
