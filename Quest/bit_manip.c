'''
Write a function bit_manip that takes in an arbitrary 
64-bit unsigned integer, and for every 
N = 31 set of bits starting from LSB (considering the
number zero-extended to a multiple of N bits), 

1. Rotate them left by R = 16 bits
2. Turn on bit 17
3. Turn off bit 27 (within each group of  31 bits)
4. Return the final value.

REMINDER: the score shown will be 0/0; that is not your final grade. 
The autograder for each question will be run after the exam period is over.

As an example, if our input were a 16-bit number whose bits were 0bABCDEFGHIJKLMPQS 
and N = 5, we rotate it right by R = 1 bit, and ON = 1 and OFF = 3 then:

0bABCDEFGHIJKLMPQS ...being thought of as groups of N = 5 bits would become

A BCDEF GHIJK LMPQS ...then zero-extended to a multiple of N = 5 bits would become

0000A BCDEF GHIJK LMPQS ...after the rotate right by 1 bit, R = 1, would become

A0000 FBCDE KGHIJ SLMPQ ...after turning on bit ON = 1

A0010 FBC1E KGH1J SLM1Q ...after turning off bit OFF = 3

A0010 F0C1E K0H1J S0M1Q ...and returning the lowest 16 bits means weâ€™d return...
