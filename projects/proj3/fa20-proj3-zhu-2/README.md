# CS61CPU

Look ma, I made a CPU! Here's what I did:

-
Zachary Zhu - task1 and task2 ALU and RegFile, task 4 control logic, test coverage
Peter Zhu - task3 addi, task 4 CPU/CSR
Together - We tested and debugged the extra instructions together.

We had excellent discussions with each other and referred to Piazza to get much of this done.
The CPU is very cool, and we are excited for the last phase for all the instructions :O
